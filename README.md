# NEMO-eNATL60 description and assessment repository

This repository describes the twin model simulations performed in 2019 with [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) ocean model over the North Atlantic at 1/60Â° grid resolution by [Ocean-Next](https://www.ocean-next.fr/) and the [MEOM group](http://meom-group.github.io) at [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr) on MareNostrum supercomputer at [BSC](https://www.bsc.es) within a [PRACE](http://prace-ri.eu/) project.

To get an idea of what eNATL60 model data look like, you may have a look a the series of video animations  available on [Ocean-Next vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/oceannext).

## Why this repository ? 

Geoscientific numerical simulations like eNATL60 require substancial computing ressources and have a large carbon footprint. This is why we believe that they should be designed and analysed collaboratively so that they could serve many different scientific applications.

The volume of data generated by such computation is also so large that the scientific assessment of the model solution is by itself a substancial undertaking. We believe that this effort should be a community effort with input from the users of the simulation data.

We have therefore decided to gather in a GitHub repository all the relevant information related to the model set-up, experiment and production, and to propose a workflow for sharing the protocols and the results of comparison of the model solutions with observations. 

We have adopted this approach rather than a more conventional scientific article or report because we hope that an open and collaborative workflow will more effectively allow to build a shared understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of our simulations. 

More generally, we hope that this effort will help foster more collaborative and reproducible workflows in geoscientific modelling.
