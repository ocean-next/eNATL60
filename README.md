# NEMO-eNATL60 description and assessment repository

This repository contains a description of twin model simulations performed in 2019 with NEMO ocean model over the North Atlantic at 1/60Â° grid resolution. 

Because we believe that the material to be gathered here should evolve over time with the contributions of many, we have decided to document our model simulations on a GitHub repository rather than in a scientific article or in a report. With this approach, we intend to help foster more reproducible worksflows in geoscientific modelling. Should you have any comment on this repository, do not hesitate to open a GitHub issue.
