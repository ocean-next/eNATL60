# NEMO-eNATL60 description and assessment repository

This repository contains a description of twin model simulations performed in 2019 with NEMO ocean model over the North Atlantic at 1/60Â° grid resolution by Ocean-Next and IGE-MEOM. 

Because we believe that the material to be gathered here should evolve over time with the contributions of many, we have decided to document our model simulations on a GitHub repository rather than in a scientific article or in a report. With this approach, we intend to help foster more reproducible worksflows in geoscientific modelling. Should you have any comment on the structure or on the content of this repository, do not hesitate to open a GitHub issue and share your thoughts. 

## Content of the repository 
  - A statement of our [motivations](./01_motivation.md) for running these experimebrts; 
  - A list of [contributors](./02_contributors.md) involved at various stages of the project development;
  - A description of the model configuration [set-up](./02_set-up.md);
  - Details on the [production](./03_production.md) of the simulations; 
  - Information on how to access the model [data](./05_data.md);
  - Results on the [assessment](./04_assessment/README.md) of the model with respect to observational datsets;
  - A list of on-going [studies and groups](./06_dissemintation.md) using eNATL60 model data.
