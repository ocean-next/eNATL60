#  Production of NEMO-eNATL60 simulations

We provide here some information on how NEMO-eNATL60 simulations have been run. 
UNDER CONTRUCTION


## Computing resources 

Short description of Marenostrum at BSC and of the context of PRACE 16th call. Project : ReSuMPTiOn (Revealing SubMesoscale Processes and Turbulence in the Ocean). Explain how CINES has helped with the storage.


## Preprocessing

Short description of the preprocessing of input data. how the bathymetry and coastline was prepared. 


## Actual run production 

When was it run, how many cores, overall stability. 
6.3 billion compute points, 8354 x 4729 x 300 levels, 40s timestep
18000 cores. 50min per model day. 5d production segments. restart : 1.2Tb.


## IO and storage strategy 

Explain that we wanted hourly output, explain that CINES has accepted to store the data. 5day segment : 7.8Tb. total twin : 1.5Pb. Explain how we fluxed the data from Barcelona to Montpellier.
