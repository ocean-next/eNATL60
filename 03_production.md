#  Production of NEMO-eNATL60 simulations

We provide here some information on how NEMO-eNATL60 simulations have been run. 


## Computing resources 

Short description of MArenostrum at BSC and of the context of PRACE call. also mention the support of CINES For storage.


## Preprocessing

Short description of the preprocessing of input data. how the bathymetry was prepared. haow the coastline was prepared. 


## Actual run production

*Figure 1: Twin experiment design.*

When was it run, how many cores, was is stable 

## IO and storage strategy 

Explain that we wanted hourly output, explain that CINES has accepted to store the data.

Explain how we fluxed the data from Barcelona to Montpellier.
