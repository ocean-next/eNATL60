#  Production of NEMO-eNATL60 simulations

We provide here some information on how NEMO-eNATL60 simulations have been run. 
<UNDER CONTRUCTION>


## Computing resources 

Short description of Marenostrum at BSC and of the context of PRACE call. Explain how CINES has helped with the storage


## Preprocessing

Short description of the preprocessing of input data. how the bathymetry and coastline was prepared. 


## Actual run production 

When was it run, how many cores, overall stability. 


## IO and storage strategy 

Explain that we wanted hourly output, explain that CINES has accepted to store the data.

Explain how we fluxed the data from Barcelona to Montpellier.
