#  Production of NEMO-eNATL60 simulations

We provide here some information on how NEMO-eNATL60 simulations have been run. 

## Computing resources 

short description of MArenostrum at BSC and of the context of PRACE call. also mention the support of CINES For storage.

## Preprocessing

short description of the preprocessing of input data. how the bathymetry was prepared. haow the coastline was prepared. 

## Actual run production 

when was it run, how many cores, was is stable 

## IO and storage strategy 


explain that we wanted hourly output, explain that CINES has accepted to store the data.
explain how we fluxed the data from Barcelona to Montpellier.
